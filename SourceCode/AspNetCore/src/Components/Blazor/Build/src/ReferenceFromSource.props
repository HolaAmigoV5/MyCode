  Importing this file is equivalent to having:
    <PackageDependency Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Build" />
  ... except it's much more convenient when working in this repo, because it consumes the
  Blazor.Build targets/exe directly without needing this project to be packed into a .nupkg.

  This is only intended for use by other projects in this repo.

    Debugging support using dotnet-blazor serve.

    A few things to note here:
      - We have to use dotnet exec to avoid launching another process and confusing the debugger.
      - Since we're doing dotnet exec, it won't automatically rebuild the CLI project.
      - $(AdditionalRunArguments) needs to be defined before importing this file.
