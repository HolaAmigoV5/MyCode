Helix testing in ASP.NET Core
==============================

Helix is the distributed test platform that we use to run tests.  We build a helix payload that contains the publish directory of every test project that we want to test
send a job with with this payload to a set of queues for the various combinations of OS that we want to test 
for example: `Windows.10.Amd64.ClientRS4.VS2017.Open`, `OSX.1012.Amd64.Open`, `Ubuntu.1810.Amd64.Open`. Helix takes care of unzipping, running the job, and reporting results.

For more info about helix see: [SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Helix/Sdk/Readme.md), [JobSender](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Helix/Sdk/Readme.md) 

## How do I look at the results of a helix run?
There's a link embedded in the build.cmd log of the helix target on Azure Pipelines, near the bottom right that will look something like this:

The link will take you to an overview of all the tests with clickable links to the logs and each run broken down by queue. 

All of the helix runs for aspnetcore can be found here https://mc.dot.net/#/user/aspnetcore/builds

## What do I do if a test fails?
You can simulate how most tests run locally:
```
dotnet publish
cd <the publish directory>
dotnet vstest My.Tests.dll
```

If that doesn't help, you can try the Get Repro environment link from mission control and try to debug that way.

## Differences from running tests locally
Most tests that don't just work on helix automatically are ones that depend on the source code being accessible. The helix payloads only contain whatever is in the publish directories, so any thing else that test depends on will need to be included to the payload (TBD how to do this).

## Running helix tests locally
`.\build.cmd /t:Helix /p:IsHelixJob=true`

This will restore, and then publish all of the test projects including some bootstrapping scripts that will install the correct dotnet runtime/sdk before running the test assemblies on the helix machine, and upload the job to helix, it won't wait for the jobs to complete, but you can go to https://mc.dot.net/#/user/aspnetcore/builds and look for a source that matches private-yourusername

## How to skip tests on helix
There are two main ways to opt out of helix
- Skipping the entire test project via `<BuildHelixPayload>false</BuildHelixPayload>` in csproj (the default value for this is IsTestProject).
- Skipping an individual test via `[SkipOnHelix]` which might require including a compile reference to: `<Compile Include="$(SharedSourceRoot)test\SkipOnHelixAttribute.cs" />`

Make sure to file an issue for any skipped tests and include that in a comment next to either of these
